             <h3>The Battle formula for the Pokémon GO Regional Championships</h3>
             <p>In the Pokémon GO Regional Championships, battles are structured within a competitive format where players participate in head-to-head matchups using their Pokémon teams. Trainers must assemble a team of three Pokémon that fall within the predetermined CP limit, often set by the rules of the championship's specific league (Great, Ultra, or Master). Battles are conducted in a best-of-three format to determine the winner of each round. Opponents are chosen through a randomized pairing system initially, ensuring a fair and unbiased competition. As the tournament progresses, a Swiss-style pairing system is often used, where players with similar win-loss records are matched against each other. This method ensures that the most skilled and consistent trainers advance through the rounds. The top-performing players from these preliminary rounds then move on to elimination rounds, culminating in a final showdown to crown the champion. Each battle tests strategy, adaptability, and in-depth knowledge of Pokémon mechanics.</p>
